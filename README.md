# Misskey Note Delete Tool
A tool to erase posts you posted on Misskey.
The main branch is for local PCs where you can directly enter the API and URL, and the env 
branch is able to on the server and can be used for cron execution.ðŸš€

## Usage

```
go build
```

```
./main
```

When you run it, you'll be asked for an access token and the host name to connect to.


## For developers
I created this tool as part of learning Golang.
If there are any areas that can be improved or need corrections, I'd appreciate it if you could give me some advice or PR.ðŸ’¥
